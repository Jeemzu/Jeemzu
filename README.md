- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jeemzu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about game development from both an engineering and higher level design perspective.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working at Mojang Studios on exciting new things for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition! I'm learning lots of C++ and JavaScript as I work through complex testing requirements for new features of the game.
